# Unity-HDRP-Opacity-Albedo-packer
In case you have a seperate opacity map and a base (diffuse/Albedo) map. You'd need to combine them into 1 to use the transparancy in the hdrp lit shader. This does that for you


# Showcase
- Go from this

- To this

# How to use
- place the script in an editor folder (doesn't have to because I wrapped it in Unity_Editor preprocessor directives)
- Make the albedo and opacity map readable/writable.
- Open me by going to Tools/Opacity Albedo Packer
- place the textures in the respective slots

- Make sure the opacity map has it's transparency properly set up (either set 'Alpha Source' to 'from grayscale' or to  'Input Texture Alpha')
- Either way your preview should show the transparent squares in the preview

- It'll create a new texture with 'combined' at the end.

- Place this texture in the 'base map' slot.
- Make sure alpha clipping is enabled in the material shader.
